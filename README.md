# 🛡️ 6-Month Low-Level Security Journey

Welcome to my personal journey into the world of low-level security, binary exploitation, and reverse engineering.  
This project-based study plan is based on a structured 6-month roadmap focused on practical skills for bug bounty and CTFs, with an emphasis on Linux systems.

## 🚀 Goals

- Build a solid understanding of binary formats and memory layouts
- Reverse engineer binaries using Ghidra and IDA Free
- Write real exploits using pwntools and GDB
- Analyze and bypass memory protections (ASLR, PIE, NX, stack canaries)
- Apply skills to bug bounty reports or CTF challenges
